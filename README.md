Tell Me if this is blocked
This is not a link to shellshockers, but rather a list of shellshockers links from their website.  If they are blocked, tell me and I will try to work something out.  I am workingon getting a full shellshockers link- it will work fine through Github but I need the source code which I am finding.  If anyone knows the source code, tell me.  I can code it into something else as well- not just github.  Please notify me at nidhishinu0315@k12.ipsd.org about this, this includes my friends who know my email (please don't share it)
